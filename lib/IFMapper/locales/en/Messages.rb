LMB - Left   Mouse Button
MMB - Middle Mouse Button
RMB - Right  Mouse Button

Mouse controls
--------------

Use  LMB to add new locations or connections among rooms.

Click with LMB on any room or connection to select it.

Double click on rooms or connections to access their properties.

Click several times on an existing connecion to establish a one-way 
connection.

Drag with MMB or ALT + LMB to scroll around the page.

Use mousewheel to zoom in and out.

Use RMB after selecting a connection to bring a menu to allow you
to flip its direction or to attach it to some other exit in one 
of the rooms.

Keyboard controls
-----------------

Use 'x' to start a new complex connection (ie. a connection across
rooms that are not neighbors), then click on each exit of each room.

Use 'Delete' or 'Backspace' to remove any selected connection or room.

Use arrow keys or numeric keypad to move selected rooms around 
the page, one unit at a time.

Use CTRL + LMB when adding a connection to create a dead-end 
connection (one that loops onto itself)
